Welcome to my portfolio website. CodeSonia is myself and a brand that I have built for this project. You will find a fun, interactive website that showcases my skills, work history and recent projects. 

A live website can be found [here](https://codesonia.github.io/CodeSonia_Personal_Portfolio/)

Take a read below, and see why I have chosen to put in place certain features.

# UX

Before writing any code, I did some user research. I used Jesse James Garett's user-centred Design process to ensure my website is useful, usable and provides value to both targeted users and myself as the product owner. 

In essence, CodeSonia should be:

- Useful: useful to the user who wants to interact with your product.
- Useable: when interacting with your product, it is also an enjoyable experience - it generates a positive emotional response.
- Valuable: valuable to the user and the product owner. 

## Strategy

### Project goal: To get noticed

The main goal for the website is to get noticed from its targeted users. Its users are recruiters (including tech & internal), developers, designers and start-ups.

#### User goals:
- Recruiters would want to hire the applicant or provide job opportunities.
- Designers or developers would want to get in touch with me for collaboration on a project.
- Start-ups are growing so they would be looking to find someone who can help raise their business by building an app or website. 
- The goals and the needs of myself are to present me in the best light and get hired as a new developer. 

Users should have the ability to reach out to me provided the contact information is correct. They should find the website easy to navigate and does not restrict them. They should be able to see my skills, previous work experience and competencies. I would also want them to access recent work/projects that I have been working on to showcase that I can code using different languages. 

To achieve this goal and to stand out amongst other developers, the online website will be more than a CV. It will prove that I can do what I talk about, and interacting with my site should elicit a positive emotional response. This means finding the site intuitive, enjoyable and straightforward. Rather than telling prospective employers about CodeSonia's skills, CodeSonia bridges the knowledge gap by providing case examples of completed projects to showcase CodeSonia's skills.

As well as this, my goal is to use the portfolio website to build a personal brand. But, as I have no commercial experience, this is not an essential priority. As I evolve and gain industry experience, I will be able to showcase my personality.

#### User Expectations:
The content should give me the necessary information about who is CodeSonia.
- Can I contact Sonia?
- Can I access personal details, work history and skillset? This is so I can assess if CodeSonia is the right fit for me.
- The user interface is easy to navigate.
- Can I access the website on mobile, and is it responsive?
- I want to be able to view her previous projects and work.

### User Stories:

As a product owner...
- I want to humanise my brand and showcase who CodeSonia is by providing an image, contact information, and a story to increase CodeSonia’s brand awareness.
- I want to illustrate my projects so that I can appeal to prospective recruiters/employers.
- I want to provide the ability for users to contact me with any requests, or with the ability to book a friendly conversation for networking purposes.
- I want to provide my social media channels, so prospective employers/recruiters can put a face/personality to CodeSonia.
- I want to showcase CodeSonia in her best light by providing her most significant achievements to convey the message that CodeSonia is motivated, passionate and driven in any work setting.
- I want to illustrate CodeSonia’s technical skills in a visual format so that employers/recruiters gain a better understanding of the skillset.
- I want to illustrate other skills in a fun, engaging format so that users can see that CodeSonia has soft skills that are also required for the roles they are advertising.
- I want to showcase CodeSonia’s work history so that employers can gain a better understanding of the experience learned.
- I want to showcase CodeSonia’s educational background to illustrate the different qualifications have been achieved.
- I want users to have positive, enjoyable user experience with CodeSonia’s so that they can come back to the site, contact the user with prospective job opportunities. 
- I want to provide a downloadable format of the CV so that users can have access to a traditional form of CV besides a portfolio.
- I want developers or start-ups to feel that they can quickly request to collaborate on a project.
- I want to showcase CodeSonia in her best light and that she is passionate about things within the tech industry, or females trying to get into tech - thought leadership exercise.
- I want users to quickly identify what page of the website they are on and can easily navigate from one section to another section without any hassle = ensure positive user journey at all touchpoints!

As a recruiter...
- I want to learn about the developer and who this person is beside the technical skills and view if they also have the right soft skills to assess if they can fit within the team.
- I want to be able to contact the developer to discuss potential opportunities at hand and build a great rapport as developing relationships with developers are essential. 
- I want the website to provide easy access to contact information, telephone number, email, social media links and a google map link so I am able to ascertain where the developer is based and can quickly contact them with exciting opportunities at hand.
- I want to be able to book some time with the developer on their website so that I can avoid time hassle.
- I want to be able to connect the developer using LinkedIn or professional social media channels to keep up to date with the developer’s work history or any changes.
- I expect to be able to quickly get in contact via an easy to use the contact form so that I can build a relationship or present any job opportunities at hand.
- I want to learn about the developer and who this person is beside the technical skills and view if they also have the right soft skills to assess if they can fit within the team.
- Having access to CodeSonia’s background and work history provides them with a brief overview of CodeSonia’s competencies, technical & soft skills.
- I want to view the developer’s educational background to see how they got into software development/coding.
- If accessing the developer’s site on mobile or tablet, I expect the website to be mobile friendly and can adhere to different devices so that I can easily navigate on smaller devices.
- I want to see a word or pdf format of the CV so that I can assess the candidate’s work history and skills to ascertain if they are the right person for the job and pass their details and link the portfolio to my clients.
- I want to find what I am looking for quickly, and I want the layout of the site to make sense, so I am not confused or put off from using it. 
- I want the information presented in a way that is intuitive, easy to navigate, so I can find out what I need effectively and efficiently.

As a collaborator...
- I want to view the developer’s project to ascertain if the developer can produce the type of things I am looking to build.
- I want to use a feature on the website to book a meeting or a phone call to ease the process of waiting for an email back or telephone call.
- I want to view the developer’s project to ascertain if the developer can produce the type of things I am looking to build.
- I want to view the developer’s project to ascertain if the developer can produce the type of things I am looking to build.
- For start-ups or users who are looking to hire a contractor, they would want to see a different type of content, including blogs. 
- I expect the user interface that is easy to use and not complex, where information is laid out logically so that I can easily digest the information provided.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
